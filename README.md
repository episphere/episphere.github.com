## Connect
Cancer Precision Prevention places an increasing focus on data-intensive platforms that can reach, and can be engaged, as consumer-facing digital applications. Ultimately, the emergence of a *Learning Health Care System* is orchestrated by computational systems that orchestrate both medical reccords and consumer-facing services, from wearable sensors to genomics. A new generation of cohort studies, such as [NCI/DCEG Connect](https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/who-we-study/cohorts/connect), is being designed accordingly. 

## Commons
Identifying novel algorithms and designing Web Applications backed by Cloud hosted APIs is a new upbiquitous technology stack. EpiSphere seeks to integrate the multitue of data streams generated and consumed by health related systems in real time. The contextualization of individual observatin by reference BigData relies on the API ecosystem provided by Epidemiology Data Commons.
