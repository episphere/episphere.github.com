## Motivation
Cancer Precision Prevention places an increasing focus on data-intensive platforms that can reach, and can be engaged, as consumer-facing digital applications. Ultimately, the emergence of a *Learning Health Care System* is orchestrated by computational systems that orchestrate both medical reccords and consumer-facing services, from wearable sensors to genomics. A new generation of cohort studies, such as [NCI/DCEG Connect](https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/who-we-study/cohorts/connect)
